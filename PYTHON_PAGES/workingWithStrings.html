    <div class="container-fluid row PythonStringsPara">
        Before beginning to learn about strings it is important to understand the difference between string values and string literals:<br>
        A string literal is what you see in the source code of a computer program, including the quotation marks.<br>
        A string value is what you see when the print() function is called, without the quotations marks.
    </div>

    <div class="container-fluid row PyStringConcat">
    <p class="stringTitles">String Concatenation</p>
    This is the joining of strings. <br>
        To concatenate two strings together, you use the '+' operator. <br>
        If a whitespace is needed, include a whitespace in one of the strings. <br>
        <pre>
        first_name = "Chloe "
        last_name = "Ridley"
        full_name = first_name + last_name
        print("full_name")
        =>
        "Chloe Ridley"
        </pre>
        If no whitespace was included in the first_name variable, the result would have been ChloeRidley because Python would not have known to include a whitespace. <br>
        When concatenating two or more strings together, Python is creating a new string that can be used throughout the programme.
    </div>

    <div class="row container-fluid stringRep">
    <p class="stringTitles">String Replication</p>
    In python you can repeat a string multiple times using the * operater:<br>
        <pre>
        name = "Chloe"
        print(name * 3)
        =>
        ChloeChloeChloe
        </pre>
        As with concatenation, if you want spaces in the output, they need to be included in the original string.
    </div>

    <div class="row container-fluid FormattingStrings">
    <p class="stringTitles">Formatting Strings</p>
    Sometimes additional formatting is needed within a string to ensure string values are displayed as intended for the user. <br>
    To span a string over multi-lines you can use either a triple single quotation or triple double quotations marks.
        <pre>
        '''
        I am
        a multi
        line
        string.
        '''
        </pre>

        <pre>
        """
        I am also
        a multi
        line
        string.
        """
        </pre>
        Escape characters can also be used to help format strings, some of the most common are:
        <table class="table container text-center">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">NOTATION</th>
      <th scope="col">WHAT IT DOES</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">\</th>
      <td>Tells Python to treat the quotation following it as part of the string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">\n</th>
      <td>Starts a new line in the string.</td>
    </tr>
      <tr>
      <th scope="row">\t</th>
      <td>Indents the line in the string.</td>
    </tr>

  </tbody>
</table><br>
        Escape characters work well for short strings, but for longer strings the multi-line technique is preferred.<br>
        Sometimes the quotation marks or backslashes are needed in the string literal, this is where raw formatting can be used. This tell python to ignore all the formatting within a string and include all escape characters.<br><br>

        <pre>
        str = r"hello\how\'are\you\m'k"

        print(str) => hello\how\'are\you\m'k
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="row container-fluid PyStringFunctions">
    <p class="stringTitles">String Functions</p>
        Built-in Python functions allow us to easily modify and manipulate strings. <br>
        You should note that strings are a immutable data type, meaning the returned string will be a new string, not the old one modified.<br><br>

        Two common functions are:<br>
        str.upper() - This converts all to upper case. <br>
        str.lower() - This converts all to lower case.<br>
        These two functions are useful when data is being inputed by a user which is then later evaluated by someone. Because Python is case sensitive, it allows all the data to be converted to lower or upper, so that other functions can be used on it and the evaluation is more accurate. <br><br>

        Python also has string functions that evaluate to a Boolean value:<br>
        <table class="table container text-center">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">FUNCTION</th>
      <th scope="col">WHAT IT DOES</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">str.isalnum() </th>
      <td>True is only alphanumeric values. No symbols</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">str.isalpha() </th>
      <td>True if only letters. No symbols</td>
    </tr>
      <tr>
      <th scope="row">str.islower() </th>
      <td>True if letters are all lower case</td>
    </tr>
      <tr>
      <th scope="row">str.isnumeric() </th>
      <td>True if consists of only numbers.</td>
    </tr>
      <tr>
      <th scope="row">str.isspace() </th>
      <td>True if only whitespace characters</td>
    </tr>
      <tr>
      <th scope="row">str.istitle() </th>
      <td>True if string is in title case</td>
    </tr>
      <tr>
      <th scope="row">str.isupper() </th>
      <td>True if letters are all upper case.</td>
    </tr>

  </tbody>
</table><br>
        Below is a string example, which has had all the functions applied to it. See if you get them right and then click the button to see the answers. <br>

        my_string = "Hello How Are You Today" <br><br>

        print(my_string.isalnum()) <span class="func">False</span><br>
        print(my_string.isalpha()) <span class="func">False</span><br>
        print(my_string.islower()) <span class="func">False</span><br>
        print(my_string.isnumeric()) <span class="func">False</span><br>
        print(my_string.isspace()) <span class="func">False</span><br>
        print(my_string.istitle()) <span class="func">True</span><br>
        print(my_string.isupper()) <span class="func">False</span><br><br>

        <button id="functionTrigger">Click here!!</button><br><br>

        Boolean methods are useful when you want to check whether something a user enters fits the parameters. <br><br>

        The length method returns the number of characters in a string. This include all whitespaces, symbols, numbers and letters. <br>
        It can be useful to check password parameters.<br>
        <pre>
        my_length_string = "Hello my name is Chloe Ridley"

        print(len(my_length_string)) => 29
        </pre>
        The str.join() method joins two strings together, in a way that passes one string through another.
        Click the string to see the results:<br><br>

        <span id="joinTrigger">
        my_length_string = "Hello my name is Chloe Ridley"<br>

        print("*".join(my_length_string))</span><br><br>

        <span id="join">H*e*l*l*o* *m*y* *n*a*m*e* *i*s* *C*h*l*o*e* *R*i*d*l*e*y</span><br><br>
        The str.join() method is also useful to combine a list of strings into a new single string: <br>
        print(", ".join(['bike','hike','ski','swim']))<br>
        =><br>
        bike, hike, ski, swim<br><br>

        The str.split() method returns a list of strings that are seperated by whitespace if no parameters are given. It can also be used to remove parts of the string.<br><br>

        my_string = "hello my name is chloe"<br>

        print(my_string.split())<br>
        =><br>
        ['hello', 'my', 'name', 'is', 'chloe']<br><br>

        print(my_string.split("e"))<br>
        =><br>
        ['h', 'llo my nam', ' is chlo', '']<br><br>

        The str.replace() method takes an original string and returns an updated string with some replacement. It takes two arguments, the first is the part of the string being replaced, the second is the replacement.<br><br>
        replace_string = "Good morning"<br>

        print(replace_string.replace("morning", "evening"))<br>
        =><br>
        Good evening<br> <br>

        The str.count() method counts the number of times a particular character or a sequence of characters show up in a string. It is case sensitive, which is where .upper and .lower methods come in handy. <br><br>

        count_example = "He said Hello, she said Hello, everybody said Hello"<br><br>
        print(count_example.count("a")) <br>
        =><br>
        3<br><br>
        print(count_example.count("Hello"))<br>
        => <br>
        3<br><br>
        print(count_example.count("hello"))<br>
        =><br>
        0<br><br>

        The str.find() method returns the postion of a character based on index number. If there is more than one it will return the postion of the first one.<br><br>
        count_example = "He said Hello, she said Hello, everybody said Hello"<br><br>
        print(count_example.find("a")) <br>
        =><br>
        4<br><br>
        print(count_example.find("Hello")) <br>
        =><br>
        8<br><br>
    </div>

    <div class="row container-fluid PyIndexStrings">
    <p class="stringTitles">Indexing strings</p>
        Each character in a string corresponds to an index number, the first character being 0. Indexing strings allows us to manipulate and access strings within data. <br><br>
       Ie. In the string "hello World!", the 'h' would be index 0, the whitespace would be index 5 and the '!' would be 11. <br><br>
        Strings can also be indexed with negative numbers, this is useful when you need to access a character towards the end in a very long string. It starts at -1.<br><br>
        I.e in "hello World!", the '!' would be -1, the 'W' would be -6.<br><br>
        To access characters in a string using index numbers you used the square brackets.<br><br>
        my_string = "hello world!"<br>
        print(my_string[2])<br>
        =><br>
        l<br><br>
        print(my_string[-6])<br>
        =><br>
        w<br><br>

        <p class=stringTitles>Slicing strings.</p>
        You can take a 'slice' out of a string with the slice method.<br>
        It uses the syntax [x:y], where x is inclusive and y is exclusive. <br><br>
        my_string = "hello world!"<br>
        print(my_string[0:5])<br>
        =><br>
        hello<br><br>
        If you only want to include either ends of the string you omit one of the numbers in the [x:y] syntax. i.e. <br><br>
        my_string = "hello world!"<br>
        print(my_string[:5])<br>
        =><br>
        hello<br><br>
        my_string = "hello world!"<br>
        print(my_string[6:])<br>
        =><br>
        world!<br><br>
        <p class="stringTitles">Stride in strings</p>
        Slicing strings can take a third parameter; the stride.<br>
        This is the number of characters Python moves forwards once the first character is received. <br>
        The default number is 1. <br><br>
        my_string = "hello world!"<br>
        print(my_string[0:12:2])<br>
        =><br>
        hlowrd<br>
        This is because it skips every other character. <br><br>
        If you put;<br>
        my_string = "hello world!"<br>
        print(my_string[::-1])<br>
        =><br>
        !dlrow olleh<br>
        It reverses the order of the string.
    </div>

    <div class="row container-fluid stringFormatters">
    <p class="stringTitles">String Formatters</p>
        Formatters work by allowing you to put placeholders {} into a string and call the str.format() method later with a value to fill the placeholder.<br>

        <pre>
        my_string = "Chloe enjoys {}"
        print(my_string.format("biking"))
        =>
        Chloe enjoys biking
        </pre>
        You can put more than one argument in the parantheses of the format method. By default Python fills curly braces in the order of the arguments.<br>
        However, they are indexed in the same way that strings are, giving us more choices on how to modify the string.<br>
        <pre>
        my_string = "Learning is {1}, especially {0}."
        print(my_string.format("fun", "Python"))
        =>
        Learning is fun, especially Python.
        </pre>
        If it is a long placeholder value, you can asign it a keyword argument:<br>
        <pre>
        my_string = "{0} the {1} developed a {in}."
        print(my_string.format("Chloe", "web developer", in="interactive website"))
        =>
        Chloe the web developer developed a interactive website.
        </pre>

        When passing through a value in the {}, you can also use the {field_name:conversion}
        syntax.<br>
        The field_name tells Python the index number of the value in the str.format.<br>
        The conversion tells Python the conversion code of the data type that we are using within the formatter. To find out more about the conversion types visit the offical documents of Python, but some of the most common ones are:<br>
        s - string <br>
        d - decimal place (10-base)<br>
        f - floats with decimal place.<br>
        <pre>
        my_money = "Chloe had {1:f} in her {0}"
        print(my_money.format("bank", 18.79))
        =>
        Chloe had 18.790000 in her bank.
        </pre>
        Because we have used the 'f' conversion type, Python returns a float number, but as you can see there are too many decimal places. You can declare how many decimal place you want by doing the following.
        <pre>
        print("Chloe had {1:.2f} in her {0}".format("bank", 18.79))
        =>
        Chloe had 18.79 in her bank.
        </pre>
        By defining .2f in the placeholder, Python only puts two decimal places.<br>
        If 0 decimal places are wanted use .0f<br><br>

        Variables can also be passed through formatters.
        <pre>
        cake = 2
        bday = "Chloe has {} cakes for her birthday!"
        print(bday.format(cake))
        =>
        Chloe has 2 cakes for her birthday!
        </pre>
        With formatters you can also add padding to the placeholder by adding a number to the right of the : <br>
        > will align right <br>
        ^ will align center <br>
        The less than symbol will align left.
        <pre>
        my_string = "Chloe {0:>6} to {1:^16}"
        print(my_string.format("loves", "code"))
        =>
        Chloe  loves to       code
        </pre>
        By default, Python will use whitespace unles otherwise stated.
        <pre>
        my_string = "{:*^20s}"
        print(my_string.format("Chloe"))
        =>
        *******Chloe********
        </pre>
